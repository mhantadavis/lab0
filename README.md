Lab 0 for CS100, Fall 2019

The goal of my site was to make it visually appealing. I did not want much text. I wanted images. I wanted my home page to be a profile shot of me and for users to easily navigate to the other pages. I used Bootstrap's tabs (nav) to create links to the other pages of my site. On the page "My Favorite Songs", I used Bootstrap's "embed-responsive embed-responsive" to embed my videos. I also used tables to place the videos in an organized fashion. My profile page was a simple (and I think funny) sentence about myself. I did not want the rest of the page to be blank so I included a mirror selfie of myself.
